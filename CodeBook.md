The final tidy dataset contains four columns:
==============================================

- 'subject': The volunteer number.
- 'activity': The activity being performed by the volunteer(WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING).
- 'variable': The variable being measured from the smartphones accelerometer and gyroscope.
- 'mean_value': The average value of that variable for that subject and that activity.
